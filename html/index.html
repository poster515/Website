								  <h3>Tomasulo Lite Processor</h3>
								  <p>
										This project involved the design, development, and test of a 16-bit soft processor.
										This processor, dubbed "Tomasulo Lite" after the original Tomasulo Algorithm, was written
										in VHDL, and utilizes a 5-stage pipeline, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, and
										in-order commits to speed-up execution time. To-date the best clocks-per-instruction (CPI)
										achieved is 1.6 - a marked improvement over a CPI of 5.0 for the equivalent, non-pipelined
										processor:

								  <h3>Nixi Tube Clock</h3>
								  <p>
										This project was based around old, military-style filament bulbs that each contain the digits
										0 through 9. The project uses an Arduino Nano, ESP8266, and Cyclone IV FPGA. The Arduino
										pings a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server requesting an accurate time stamp, then re-packetizes
										and transmits this data to the FPGA. The FPGA unpacks the data, decodes it, and drives a total of
										(4 nixi tubes) * (10 digits per nixi tube) = 40 digits via high-power BJTs.

								  <h3>Disc Golf Scoring Application</h3>
								  <p>
										This project was written for Android phones and based around Java and SQL. The app was basic in that
										there was no cloud functionality - all data was stored locally due to the small amount of it. The app
										allowed users to create disc golf courses (assume holes and pars), play each course with an arbitrary number
										of players, and either save or delete each game played. Once saved, users could view their best game for
										any given course, view the best player's game at any course, and so on.

								  <h3>CS50 Final Project</h3>
								  <p>
										This project involved an almost full stack development of a website, utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python,
										and SQL. A comprehensive description can be seen in the associated
										<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAwRVOzAsN4&t=1s">YouTube video</a> that I made. The site is a powerlifting
										oriented site, allowing the admin to create powerlifting events and allowing users to register for them. Users
										also had personalized home pages that showed their previous events and a graph displaying the results of each
										previous event.
